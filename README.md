# FEUP-DA-PROJ1

## First project for the DA course unit at FEUP.

The main task of this work is to implement a system capable of managing a modern urban delivery system.

## Building

This project uses [cmake](https://cmake.org/). Assuming it's installed and properly setup, simply run `cmake -S . -B build` in this project's directory to generate the build system, then `cmake --build build` to actually build the project.

This will generate one binary in the `build` directory, `logistics`.

## Running

Simply run the executable generated in the last section.
